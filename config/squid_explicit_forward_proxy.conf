# Origin config inspiration: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Setting_up_Explicit_Squid_Proxy
# Tested and working on squid 3.3.10-r0 and Alpine 2.7.1 (kernel 3.10.19-0-grsec), 64-bit
## Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
## Adapt to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing
## should be allowed
acl localnet src 10.0.0.0/8	# RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 172.16.0.0/12	# RFC1918 possible internal network
acl localnet src 192.168.0.0/16	# RFC1918 possible internal network
## Allow anyone to use the proxy (you should lock this down to client networks only!):
# acl localnet src all
## IPv6 local addresses:
acl localnet src fc00::/7       # RFC 4193 local private network range
acl localnet src fe80::/10      # RFC 4291 link-local (directly plugged) machines

acl SSL_ports port 443
acl Safe_ports port 80		# http
acl Safe_ports port 21		# ftp
acl Safe_ports port 443		# https
acl Safe_ports port 70		# gopher
acl Safe_ports port 210		# waiss

acl Safe_ports port 591		# filemaker
acl Safe_ports port 777		# multiling http
acl CONNECT method CONNECT
acl QUERY urlpath_regex cgi-bin \? asp aspx jsp

## Prevent caching jsp, cgi-bin etc
cache deny QUERY

## Only allow access to the defined safe ports whitelist
http_access deny !Safe_ports

## Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

## Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
http_access allow localhost manager
http_access deny manager

## We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
## web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
## one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
http_access deny to_localhost

##
## INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
##

## Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
## Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
## from where browsing should be allowed
#http_access allow localnet
#http_access allow localhost
http_access allow all

## And finally deny all other access to this proxy
#http_access deny all

## Squid normally listens to port 3128
http_port 3128
## If you have multiple interfaces you can specify to listen on one IP like this:
#http_port 1.2.3.4:3128 

## Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
## 1024 is the disk space to use for cache in MB, adjust as you see fit!
## Default is no disk cache
#cache_dir ufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Better, use 'aufs' cache type, see 
##http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/cache_dir/ for info.
#cache_dir aufs /var/cache/squid 1024 16 256
## Recommended to only change cache type when squid is stopped, and use 'squid -z' to
## ensure cache is (re)created correctly

## Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
#coredump_dir /var/cache/squid

## Where does Squid log to?
#access_log /var/log/squid/access.log
## Use the below to turn off access logging
access_log none
## When logging, web auditors want to see the full uri, even with the query terms
#strip_query_terms off
## Keep 7 days of logs
#logfile_rotate 7

## How much RAM, in MB, to use for cache? Default since squid 3.1 is 256 MB
cache_mem 64 MB

## Maximum size of individual objects to store in cache
maximum_object_size 1 MB

## Amount of data to buffer from server to client 
read_ahead_gap 64 KB

## Use X-Forwarded-For header?
## Some consider this a privacy/security risk so it is often disabled
## However it can be useful to identify misbehaving/problematic clients
#forwarded_for on 
forwarded_for delete 

## Suppress sending squid version information
httpd_suppress_version_string on

## How long to wait when shutting down squid
shutdown_lifetime 30 seconds

## Replace the User Agent header.  Be sure to deny the header first, then replace it :)
#request_header_access User-Agent deny all
#request_header_replace User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 9.0; en-US)

## What hostname to display? (defaults to system hostname)
#visible_hostname a_proxy

## Use a different hosts file?
#hosts_file /path/to/file

## Add any of your own refresh_pattern entries above these.
refresh_pattern ^ftp:		1440	20%	10080
refresh_pattern ^gopher:	1440	0%	1440
refresh_pattern -i (/cgi-bin/|\?) 0	0%	0
refresh_pattern .		0	20%	4320
