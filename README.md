# Introduction

`Dockerfile` to create a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image for [Squid proxy server](http://www.squid-cache.org/).

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. It reduces bandwidth and improves response times by caching and reusing frequently-requested web pages. Squid has extensive access controls and makes a great server accelerator.

Based on the Squid container by [sameersbn](https://github.com/sameersbn/docker-squid), with some changes:

- Based on Alpine base image and packages

## Contributing

If you find this image useful here's how you can help:

- Send a pull request with your awesome features and bug fixes
- Help users resolve their [issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).

## Issues

Before reporting your issue please try updating Docker to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue. Refer to the Docker [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/installation) for instructions.

SELinux users should try disabling SELinux using the command `setenforce 0` to see if it resolves the issue.

If the above recommendations do not help then [report your issue](../../issues/new) along with the following information:

- Output of the `docker version` and `docker info` commands
- The `docker run` command used to start the image. Mask out the sensitive bits.
- Please state if you are using [Boot2Docker](http://www.boot2docker.io), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), etc.

# Getting started

## Installation

```bash
docker pull stackhpc/squid:latest
```

Alternatively you can build the image yourself.

```bash
docker build -t stackhpc/squid github.com/stackhpc/docker-squid
```

## Quickstart

Start Squid using:

```bash
docker run --name squid -d --restart=always \
  --publish 3128:3128 \
  --volume /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts:ro \
  --volume /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  --volume /srv/docker/squid/log:/var/log/squid \
  --volume /srv/docker/squid/cache:/var/spool/squid \
  stackhpc/squid:latest
```

## Command-line arguments

You can customize the launch command of the Squid server by specifying arguments to `squid` on the `docker run` command. For example the following command prints the help menu of `squid` command:

```bash
docker run --name squid -it --rm \
  --publish 3128:3128 \
  --volume /srv/docker/squid/log:/var/log/squid \
  --volume /srv/docker/squid/cache:/var/spool/squid \
  stackhpc/squid:latest squid -h
```

## Persistence

For the cache to preserve its state across container shutdown and startup you should mount a volume at `/var/spool/squid`.

> *The [Quickstart](#quickstart) command already mounts a volume for persistence.*

SELinux users should update the security context of the host mountpoint so that it plays nicely with Docker:

```bash
mkdir -p /srv/docker/squid
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /srv/docker/squid
```

## Configuration

Squid is a full featured caching proxy server and a large number of configuration parameters. To configure Squid as per your requirements mount your custom configuration at `/etc/squid/squid.conf`.

```bash
docker run --name squid -d --restart=always \
  --publish 3128:3128 \
  --volume /path/to/squid.conf:/etc/squid/squid.conf \
  --volume /srv/docker/squid/cache:/var/spool/squid \
  stackhpc/squid:latest
```

To reload the Squid configuration on a running instance you can send the `HUP` signal to the container.

```bash
docker kill -s HUP squid
```

## Usage

Configure your web browser network/connection settings to use the proxy server which is available at `172.17.0.1:3128`

If you are using Linux then you can also add the following lines to your `.bashrc` file allowing command line applications to use the proxy server for outgoing connections.

```bash
export ftp_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128
export http_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128
export https_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128
```

To use Squid in your Docker containers add the following line to your `Dockerfile`.

```dockerfile
ENV http_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128 \
    https_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128 \
    ftp_proxy=http://172.17.0.1:3128
```

## Logs

To access the Squid logs, located at `/var/log/squid/`, you can use `docker exec`. For example, if you want to tail the access logs:

```bash
docker exec -it squid tail -f /var/log/squid/access.log
```

You can also mount a volume at `/var/log/squid/` so that the logs are directly accessible on the host.

# Maintenance

## Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases:

  1. Download the updated Docker image:

  ```bash
  docker pull stackhpc/squid:latest
  ```

  2. Stop the currently running image:

  ```bash
  docker stop squid
  ```

  3. Remove the stopped container

  ```bash
  docker rm -v squid
  ```

  4. Start the updated image

  ```bash
  docker run -name squid -d \
    [OPTIONS] \
    stackhpc/squid:latest
  ```

## Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell. If you are using Docker version `1.3.0` or higher you can access a running containers shell by starting `bash` using `docker exec`:

```bash
docker exec -it squid sh
```
